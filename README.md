Requirements
Given the below table, write the JSX equivalent. Add the code for the following requirements within the src/index.js file.

Step 1
You must use an ES6 arrow function named stateInfo to provide the JSX - Define the table headers within this function (i.e. State, Population, etc.) - The function must have the same amount of parameters as the table has data - Use curly braces

Step 2
Use the render() method to define the data from the table to be used in the JSX

Step 3
Display your JSX table onto the webpage - The index.html has a div tag with an id of root. Use the DOM to target this tag and display the table.

Example
Table with 3 columns titled state, population, and capital. The first state is Idaho, the population is blank, and the capital is Boise. The second state is Tennessee, the population is 6 point 6 5 1 million, and the capital is Nashville. The third state is Maine. The population is 1 point 3 3 1 million, and the capital is Agusta. The last state is Wisconsin, the population is 5 point 7 7 9 million, and the capital is Madison.
